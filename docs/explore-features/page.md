title: Introducing Your Project
---

A single project represents one or more automations for apps you use every day. You can use premade projects or create your own from scratch. Every automation in your project should be thematically related.

Here are some examples:

- WHEN I add a new row to a Google Sheet, export data to an external analytics app (such as Salesforce)

- WHEN I start a livestream on Twitch/Youtube/Tiktok, create a new post on Facebook/Instagram to let your followers know across all your social media apps.

- WHEN I get a new sales lead on Facebook, add the lead's data to Google Sheets.
