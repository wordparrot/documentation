If your node type requires keys, the menu selector will automatically autofill with all keys of the platform you require. Select one to proceed.

If you don't have any keys for that platform, don't fret. The form will remind you to get them first. You should stop work at this point and follow the process to add your set of credentials.

For more information, see the 'Managing Credentials' section of this documentation site.
