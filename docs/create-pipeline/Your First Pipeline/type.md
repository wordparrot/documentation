title: Filling out node information
---

When you get to the node form page, you will first need to choose a node type. Generally, node types are 'internal' or 'external'. 

Internal nodes are specific to Wordparrot features, like posting to a repository.

External nodes pertain to actions you can take on platforms outside of Wordparrot, like getting the latest tweets from Twitter.

After you select a node type, the form should drop down with a full set of options. Fill the form out as best you can. Many fields don't need to be filled, and you'll be reminded when hitting 'Submit' if you forgot something.
   
Each field should have a description for what types of values it accepts.

On the right hand side, you can see a card with information about the node as you are building it.

When you're finished, hit 'submit' to continue.
