In order to start building automations, get familiar with the major concepts of the platform.


#### Pipeline

A series of programmable actions, which we call nodes.


#### Node


These represent the actions your pipeline will carry out in sequence.

#### Repository

Where you store things that come from pipelines, whether it is raw data, social media posts, files, or anything else. They should share a theme.

For example, the 'Movie Repository' can store all movie-related data from multiple pipelines fetching from a movie database.


#### Tag

Use these to further categorize things in your repository and give them meaning. One item can have multiple tags attached to it.

#### Tile

You can connect tiles to your repositories and put them on your dashboard. Use them to continually rotate content from all of your repositories onto your main page.

You can then invite other users to share them with you!

#### Credential 

These are the special keys you'll often need to access services like Twitter via their APIs.
