Use these to further categorize things in your repository and give them meaning. One item can have multiple tags attached to it.

### Example

On Pipeline A, node 1, collect Twitter data about horror movies and attach with the 'Horror' tag.

Then on Pipeline B, node 1, collect Twitter data about action movies and attach with the 'Action' tag.

Set both Pipeline A and B to write to the Movies Repository in node 2.

Now you have a repository that is tag-sortable!
