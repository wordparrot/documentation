![Pipeline](/img/docs/create-pipeline/concepts/pipeline.png)

A series of programmable actions, which we call nodes.

Pipelines can be run manually, timed to run on a schedule, or set to run based on *events*.

Events are created when certain things happen. Designing events will let you get the most out of your pipelines.

For example, you can set an event to occur when you get an email in your inbox.

You can even set a pipeline to recieve an event when another pipeline finishes.
