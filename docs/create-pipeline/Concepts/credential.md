These are the special keys you'll often need to access services like Twitter via their APIs. 

While we can't create credentials for you, we can help you through the process of getting them. In most cases, you'll only need to do this once.

 We can then securely store them to use in your pipelines.

You'll never have to give us your passwords. Most often, we'll redirect you to the platform in question, where you'll be asked to log in. 

After you log in, that service will issue us a key that we can store for your use. That's it!

Refer to the section 'Managing Credentials' to see how you can obtain API keys for your favorite platform. The process is different for each.
