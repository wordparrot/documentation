# Introduction

Pipelines allow you to automate content collection, posting, and other types of repeatable tasks from all your favorite platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc.

This allows you to create small app-like routines that can save many hours at your job, in your side project, or sharing content with friends.

There is no limit to the number of pipelines you can create, or how often you can run them.

## Note for heavy users

For users intending to run scripts very regularly or in CPU-intensive tasks, we place limits on your regular usage.

We recommend using a managed host or self-hosting options (See the section on self hosting).
