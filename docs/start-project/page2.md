Here, you can customize a name and description for your new project.

Make sure to use specific information, like 'Automate Company Employee Tax Spreadsheet, Spring 2023'. That helps you remember what the project is doing.

This also helps you in case you'd like to automate multiple functions using the same template. You can install this project type as many times as you like, for as many purposes as you'd like.
