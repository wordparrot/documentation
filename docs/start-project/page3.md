From here, you can customize account details, so Wordparrot can properly access your account and automate work for you.

Very often, you'll be prompted for some form of authentication credentials.

For most apps, you authenticate by providing your username and password, or by using a third-party sign in (such as Sign-In with Google/Apple/Facebook).

Each app has its own process for checking that activity on your account is legitimate.

For Wordparrot to work properly, you'll need to create a credential. A credential allows Wordparrot to perform operations on your behalf, such as getting information about your latest post, or submitting a new post.
