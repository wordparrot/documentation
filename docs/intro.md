Wordparrot is an shareable automation platform. 

On the platform, you can create a series of programmable actions, like fetching data from a server, sending emails, or updating your social media page. These are called 'pipelines'.

Best of all, you don't always have to think of how to make pipelines yourselves. Community users can create pipelines and you can subscribe, to save on the work of having to duplicate this yourself.
