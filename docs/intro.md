Wordparrot is a shareable automation platform.

Wordparrot connects the apps that you use together to make an automated process. These processes can save you many hours at your job or personal projects. They work best when deployed across a team or department, to reduce its workload in inefficient tasks.

If you know tools like Zapier, some of its core features closely represent the same software features.

Wordparrot's core application is open-source, and generally packaged via Docker container.
