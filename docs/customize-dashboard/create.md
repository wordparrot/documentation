### Creating a new tile

Tiles can be created by clicking 'Create Tile' in the dashboard menu.

When creating a tile, you must link it to a repository. In addition, you may add tags to your tile to filter the type of content it receives.

### Managing your tile subscriptions

Creating a tile automatically subscribes you to the tile. However, your dashboard only has so much space. Should you want to rotate the tiles, that you see, you can set your tile subscription to 'active' or 'disabled'.

### Invite others to subscribe to your tiles

You can invite other users to share tiles with you.

Enter the user's email address to send an invitation. If the email is associated with a valid user, they will receive a notification on their dashboard and be given the option to subscribe.

### Removing tiles

You can destroy a tile to completely remove it from your account. Keep in mind that it will also unsubscribe all users who are subscribed to it.
