If you've created some content with your new pipeline, you may decide to share it with the world.

Featured content is your way of broadcasting content from your automations to friends and strangers.

### What kind of content you can share

You'll be able to choose how subscribers receive this information:

- Formatted as posts

- Raw data format (most commonly JSON)

- Formatted and sent in email body/attachment

- Pushed directly to their devices (text only, with size limits)
