Featured content allows you to share what comes out of your pipeline automations.

#### Group

A thematic collection of content, organized by threads.

For example, a 'News' group can have threads pertaining to different areas of news: world news, business news, etc.

#### Subscription

If you want featured group content, you can subscribe to it. This will allow you access to all threads within the group.

Note that some groups will require paid subscriptions, and other groups may be private.

#### Thread

If you wish to publish in a group, you must choose one or more threads to receive your content.

Threads offer choices to your group's subscribers and provide meta-information about the content: where it comes from, how often publishing will occur, and how that content can be received.

#### Thread Preference

If you are choosing to receive content from a thread, this will determine how you receive it. Examples include via email, direct to a repository, or piped to your pipelines.

The group's owner ultimately decides what preference types are available in each thread.
