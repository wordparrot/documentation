In any pipeline where you'll be connecting to an outside server (including all your major social media platforms and productivity tools), you'll need to use credentials.

Credentials allow you to:

1. Identify yourself as a user of that platform.
2. You are allowed to do whatever you are trying to do.

### What they are

These credentials are commonly referred to as 'API keys' in the developer community.

They are associated with your user account, but they are distinct. They are not the same as your password. Most platforms will not issue you this API key unless you specifically request one. Many API keys are free, but in some cases you'll need to upgrade your account.

Each platform has its own signup process to get these keys. Wordparrot can help you obtain a set of keys for your favorite platform, and store them securely on our site.

### How it works

If you've ever used social media login on an unrelated website, it's a similar process. We'll ask for some details provided by the platform, and then redirect you to that webpage to confirm them. You'll need to login to your account.

Once you've successfully logged in, the platform will send us your credential, which we will store and link to your Wordparrot account. At that point, you'll be able to use the credential for your activities on Wordparrot.

### No sensitive information revealed

At no point are you required to share things like your account password with us.

### Easily canceled

In the future, should you wish to remove this key, you can easily disable its access through the third party platform's settings.

### Respect third party platform API policies

Each platform has terms of service and policies against abuse. Wordparrot requires that you read these policies carefully and agree to them before storing credentials on Wordparrot.

Wordparrot bears no responsibility for violation of a third party's API policies, including revocation of API priviles and any other applicable penalties.

### Don't share API keys

Your API key belongs specifically to you. Do not share it with anyone.
