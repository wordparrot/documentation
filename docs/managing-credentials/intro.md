In any pipeline where you'll be connecting to an outside server (including all your major social media platforms and productivity tools), you'll need to use credentials.

Credentials fulfill the important purpose of proving that:

1) You can prove your identity
2) You are allowed to do whatever you are trying to do.

### What they are

These credentials are commonly referred to as 'API keys' in the developer community. 

Each platform has its own signup process to get these keys. Wordparrot can help you obtain a set of keys for your favorite platform, and store them securely on our site. 

### How it works

If you've ever used social media login on an unrelated website, it's exactly the same process. 

At no point are you required to share things like your account password with us.
