[Official API Documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api)

You can apply for and receive a set of credentials to Twitter's API using their developer platform.

Twitter's official documentation can get very technical, so we'll take your hand through the most important steps.

### Twitter Developer Platform

Key management is handled by Twitter's developer platform, found here:

[Developer Platform](https://developer.twitter.com/)

If you don't have a regular account to Twitter yet, you'll need to make one first and login with it on the developer platform.

### Approval Required Before Proceeding

It's important to note that Twitter's API involves an application and a review process. If your application is rejected, you will not be given a reason and not able to appeal the decision. It is important to be honest and forthright about your intended uses.

The more simple your use case, the likely easier it will be to gain access. Regardless, you'll need to submit an explanation for your intended uses and wait for approval. This may take at least a day or two and possibly longer.

### Agreeing to Terms of Service

Twitter is very conscious of abusive actors on their platform. Content aggregation, tweet, analysis, and creation of Twitter bots for automated tweeting are highly regulated.

Be sure to familiarize yourself with Twitter's terms of service before proceeding.

### Sign up for an account

First, make sure you have a regular Twitter account for your personal use. If you don't yet, you can sign up for one:

In order to proceed with API access, you'll need to link the account with your phone number. You can start with email for now, but you'll be prompted again later once you've gone to the developer platform.

### Providing basic information

Once there, you'll follow a multi-step process for approval.

You'll first need to provide some basic information about yourself.

If you haven't verified your phone number at this point, you'll be asked to do so.

Indicate which type of use you intend by selecting 'Professional', 'Hobbyist', or 'Academic'. If not requesting access as part of your job or as part of academic research, then pick Hobbyist.
